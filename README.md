# Tiny Tools for AI

I seek a tiny toolkit whose parts I can mix and match to comfigur new AI solutions that are simple, fast, explainable. 

Will adopt the manifold assumption (that complex data can be approximated by somethign simpler), then drive for the simpler.

- e.g. don't do KNN on all the data, but just a few centroids
- e.g. dont seek centroids in all the data, just from some examples remote those those seen already
- e.g. try simpler models (e.g. Bayes classifeirs) before more complex things
