EZR was an ezperiment with "little AI". Big AI assmes that model building needs
massive
amounts of daa and CPU. Little AI takes an alternate approach and assumes
that models are tiny gems that hide, obscured, by vast amounts of irrelevant,
noist, or reducnadt information.

    def Data(src):
      def _guess(row):
        return sum(interpolate(data,row,*pole) for pole in poles)/len(poles)
    
      head, *rows = list(src)
      data  = _data(head, rows)
      poles = projections(data)
      for row in rows: row[-1] = _guess(row)
      return data
